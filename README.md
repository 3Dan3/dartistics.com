Files for the R Workshop with Tim 

## The website

The website will publish whatever is in the Github brand, "gh-pages" (this is just what Github looks for)

So to publish:

1. Close any files you are on.
2. Use your Github controller to switch to gh-pages branch
3. Don't panic when all the files dissappear in the folder - they are there when you switch back
4. Make your changes to the .Rmd files in the folder
5. Buid website
6. Publish the gh-pages branch to Github
7. Admire your new website
8. Switch back to master branch to work on the dev bit
