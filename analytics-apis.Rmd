One of the most compelling reasons to use R for web analysts is access to the variety of libraries for importing data from Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics.

Calling from the API can get around limitations in the web UI's such as sampling and querying certain dimensions and metrics.

# Google Analytics

There are several R packages for reaching the Google Analytics API, but the one chosen to show today is `googleAnalyticsR` as its the one the author wrote!  However you may prefer the syntax of one of the others, which are listed on the [`googleAnalyticsR` homepage](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/).

## Installation

```{r}
## This installs googleAnalyticsR if you haven't got it already
if(!require(googleAnalyticsR)) install.packages("googleAnalyticsR")
```
## Authentication

By default you can authenticate using googleAnalyticsR default project:

```{r}
library(googleAnalyticsR)
ga_auth()
```

Pause here, as the first time it should open a web browser the first time to your Google login.  

![](images/google_auth_login.png)

Sign in to give access for your session.  

This will create a `.httr-oauth` file in your working directory folder that contains your authentication details.  Keep this file safe as people could access your data if they have access to it.

## Getting your View Id

To get your data, you need to specify which Google Analytics View you want to pull it from.  

The easiest way to find this is to use `google_analytics_account_list()` to list your Views, then read the number in the `viewId` column:

```{r}
my_accounts <- google_analytics_account_list()

head(my_accounts)

## The account viewIds
head(my_accounts$viewId)
```

## Querying your data

You can then download your data via the [`v4 reporting API`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/) with the `google_analytics_4()` function.  See `?google_analytics_4` and the website for complete details and examples.

```{r}
## change this to your own ViewId
## this one will only work if you have access to Mark's blog!
my_id <- 81416156 
some_data <- google_analytics_4(my_id, 
                                date_range = c("2016-01-01", "2016-08-01"),
                                metrics = c("sessions","users","pageviews"),
                                dimensions = c("date","medium"))
head(some_data)
```

# Adobe Analytics

Adobe Analytics access is supplied via Randy Zwitch's [RSiteCatalyst](http://randyzwitch.com/rsitecatalyst/) library.

Authentication is a little harder to configure for Adobe so a live example is not shown here, but steps to download data are shown below.

## Installation

```r
## This installs a package for downloading Adobe Analytics data
if(!require(RSiteCatalyst)) install.packages("RSiteCatalyst")
```

## Authentication (New)

This is the new OAuth2 method of authentication.  Use this one if you can.

Link your Adobe Analytics login to the Adobe ID account to use this method of signin. 

### Create Application

If you have no application for your Adobe Analytics account, here is how to make one:

1. Create an app by visiting developer console and navigating to [Developer > Applications](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/applications)
2. Select "Web Server (Authorization Code)"
3. Name the application
4. Leave the Redirect Uri field blank.

![](images/setting-up-adobe-application.png)

You should then see this screen to grant permission after running `SCAuth`

![](images/adobe-app-oauth-permission.png)

## Authentication (Old)

This is the deprecated method and will dissappear 'soon'.

Get the Web Service key under the Adobe Analytics Account Information page.

* User Name is used as the key
* Sharted Secret is used as the secret

![](images/legacy-authentication-adobe.png)

If you use this method, then you authenticate via:

```r
library(RSiteCatalyst)

key <- Sys.getenv("ADOBE_KEY_OLD")
secret <- Sys.getenv("ADOBE_SECRET_OLD")

SCAuth(key, secret)
```

## Recording secret keys

I save these values to a `.Renviron` file in my home directory to keep them safe and call then via the commands below (this stops them being accidently put on github for example)

### Example .Renviron file

This is in my root directory: `~/.Renviron`

```
ADOBE_KEY="a7xxxxx639-iih-nordic-r"
ADOBE_SECRET="2eadxxxxx1495ea49"
ADOBE_KEY_OLD="mark:XXXXXX"
ADOBE_SECRET_OLD="74b46625xxxxx7e89dbe6e0"
```

## Calling Adobe Analytics

Once you have setup your authentication method, you can call data using the below.

The `SCAuth()` function will open your browser or read the existing `auth-adobe` file if using the newer OAuth2 method, or return `[1] "Credentials Saved in RSiteCatalyst Namespace."` if using legacy.


```r
library(RSiteCatalyst)

## New OAuth method
key    <- Sys.getenv("ADOBE_KEY")
secret <- Sys.getenv("ADOBE_SECRET")

SCAuth(key, secret, 
       company = "XXXXX", 
       token.file = "auth-adobe", 
       auth.method = "OAUTH2")

## Old legacy method
key <- Sys.getenv("ADOBE_KEY_OLD")
secret <- Sys.getenv("ADOBE_SECRET_OLD")

SCAuth(key, secret)

```

You should be then able to see the report suites via:

```r
suites <- GetReportSuites()
head(suites)
```

## Pulling Data Reports

There are 5 different types of Adobe Analytics reports that can be pulled out via the API:

* Overtime - `QueueOvertime()`
* Ranked - `QueueRanked()`
* Trended - `QueueTrended()`
* Pathing - `QueuePathing()`
* Fallout - `QueueFallout()`

See the characteristics of the [reports here](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/sitecatalyst-reporting/r-queueovertime)

We set some common parameters here:

```r
date.from <- "2016-03-01"
date.to <- "2016-03-29"
reportsuite.id <- "xxxxxxx"
```

### Overtime

Returns an overtime report.  This is similar to the key metrics report in that the only granularity allowed is time.

QueueOvertime requires a start and end date, a reportsuite ID, and a character vector of metrics.

```r
metrics <- c("visits","uniquevisitors","pageviews")

report.data <- QueueOvertime(reportsuite.id, date.from, date.to, metrics)
head(report.data)
```

You may also wish to set any of the 5 optional named parameters.

```r
report.data <- QueueOvertime(reportsuite.id, 
                             date.from, date.to, 
                             metrics,
                             date.granularity = "hour",
                             segment.id = "Visit_Natural_Search",
                             anomaly.detection = FALSE,
                             data.current = TRUE,
                             expedite = FALSE)  ## only if you have permission

head(report.data)
```

A similar workflow is available for the other report types. 


# Other APIs

Some noteable other APIs useful for digital marketing are described below:

## Search Console

Get your SEO keywords back after `(not provided)` via Google's Search Console.

```r
## This installs searchConsoleR if you haven't got it already
if(!require(searchConsoleR)) install.packages("searchConsoleR")
library(searchConsoleR)

## authentication similar to googleAnalyticsR
scr_auth()

seo_data <- search_analytics("your-website.com", dimensions = c("date","query"))
```

## BigQuery

Useful if you have Big Query exports from Google Analytics 360.  See [BigQuery section](http://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/big-query.html) of `googleAnalyticsR`.

```r
## This installs bigQueryR if you haven't got it already
if(!require(bigQueryR)) install.packages("bigQueryR")

library(googleAnalyticsR)

## authentication similar to googleAnalyticsR
bqr_auth()

## this function turns GA dimensions/metrics into BigQuery SQL

bq <- google_analytics_bq("project-id", "dataset-id-ga-viewid", 
                           start = "2016-01-01", end = "2016-02-01", 
                           metrics = "users", 
                           dimensions = c("source","medium"))
head(bq)
             source   medium  users
1   mavas|blahbs.ru  display  47837
2          examp.ae referral   6090
3   lm.facebook.com referral    335
4       ghtie_yahoo  display 133900
5      fjsfs_inmobi  display  19887
6 tripadvisor.co.dk referral    307 

```

For more general BigQuery extracts, it may be better to use the more developed [bigrquery()](https://github.com/rstats-db/bigrquery) instead.
