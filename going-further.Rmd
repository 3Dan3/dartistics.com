# Suggested next steps

If you would like to continue to enhance your R prowess, here is a suggested subject tree:

1. Master the [Advanced R Hadley book](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)
2. Functions - get comfortable writing your own functions for repeatable tasks.
3. Github - any coder should use some kind of source control, R's integration with Github makes it a natural fit.
4. Create a package - it doesn't have to appear in CRAN (yet!) but its a small step from sourcing a file of your custom functions to loading your own private library.
5. Shiny - being able to quickly create interactive webapps when asked for a report is always impressive 
6. Kaggle - practice your machine learning with public datasets in a friendly competative environment
7. Advanced packages - get a package on CRAN, or contribute to the development of one on Github.  Start using tests, Travis and coverage
8. Start using unit tests via `library(testthat)` to ensure robust code.
