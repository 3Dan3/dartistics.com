title: "RMarkdown and Shiny"

A recent development is the ability to put Shiny elements into an RMarkdown document. 

These documents again need a Shiny server to run, but takes advatage of the easy formatting of RMarkdown to present the user interface - server and UI elements sit in the same document.

* *RMarkdown* - supplies the HTML instead of a `ui.R` file.
* *Shiny* - supplied reactive components within your RMarkdown

An example RMarkdown document with a Shiny element taking care of authentication can be found here:
