This exercise is dependent on the successful completion of [Exercise 7](exercise7-visualisation.html).

For this exercise, we're going to push the three plots created in Exercise 7 into an HTML file using RMarkdown:

1. Create a new RMarkdown file called `visualisation-markdown`.
2. Add the single line chart to the script with the code to plot it displayed.
3. Add the chart with the lines broken out by `deviceCategory` _without_ displaying the underlying code
4. Add the grid of sparklines
5. (Add formatting?)
